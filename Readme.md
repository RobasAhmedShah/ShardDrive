## Project Title
🚀 ShardDrive: A Distributed File Backup and Recovery System with Parallel Processing


## Project Team
👥 Team Members:
- Robas Ahmed Shah
- Huzaifa Siraj

## Project Summary
ShardDrive aims to revolutionize file backup and recovery by developing a distributed system using parallel processing techniques. It will efficiently handle large files by splitting them into smaller shards and distributing these across different nodes in a network.

```

OpenMP will be utilized to parallelize the process of file sharding and recovery, enhancing performance by distributing work across multiple processors.

## Project Objectives
1. 🏗️ Implement ShardDrive's distributed file storage system
2. ⚡ Use parallel processing (OpenMP) for optimization
3. 🔄 Enable redundancy and fault tolerance
4. 🔐 Implement a robust shard recovery system
5. 📈 Support scalability for growing storage needs

## Project Scope
ShardDrive's scope includes:
